% Function computes the number of features, 
% after their deleting the error function is less than par.s_0. 
% Deleting features is implemented through the Belsley procedure.     
%   
% Input:
% X - [m, p] - design matrix with shrinkage number of predictors
% y - [m, 1] - target vector
% w - [p, 1] - vector of parameters, getting from algorithm, 
%              which is tested
% par - structure - structure with additional parameters:
%       par.s_0 - [1, 1] - limit acccepted error rate
%       par.X_unnorm - [m, p] - design matrix with shrinkage number of predictors
%                               but not normalized, because of the 
%                               Belsley diagnostic implementation
%
% Output:
% d - [1,1] - maximum number of possibly deleting features
